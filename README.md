- 👋 Hello, I'm @Lutz1966  from Germany near Cologne
- 
- 👀 I'm interested in software and hardware development, I turned my hobby into a profession and studied electrical engineering, graduating 30 years ago. Since then, I have been fascinated by Arduino and Raspberry Pi as a hobby and have already built one or two boards (self-developed).
In the field of home automation, lighting control, pool control and music electronics such as guitar amps etc.
Another hobby is model railroads, where I have also realized various projects.
In connection with hardware, I use LTspice with its own extension for statistics simulation and KICAD for the circuit diagrams.
A lot of programming is done in the Arduino IDE but also Atmel Studio.
My private hobby lab is well equipped in terms of measuring instruments, so I can measure a lot of what I program to see if it fits
- 🌱 I'm still learning, it never ends :-)
- 💞️ I would like to work on ... ??? Everything that is fun and where I can help when something needs to be measured, but I don't have that much time to get deeply involved in projects and reliably work through tasks. My passion is troubleshooting, that's my "adventure gane" on the computer
- 📫 How to reach me ... via GitHub??? works, right, I just created my account
